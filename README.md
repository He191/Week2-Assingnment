Required
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
I managed to create an image gallery similar to the sample project. I was able to set up prev and next buttons to scroll through the gallery. Also added event listeners to move the images based on keyboard clicks as well.

I have also added alternative text (alt) on all the images to make it more accessible as part of the requirement.

I also used Media queries to make responsive design of the gallery so that if any device like phone which has width less than 800px, it will work accordingly.


🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
I was able to fulfill all the mandatory requirements. I think I was short on time. If I had more time I may be able to attempt more nice to have features.


🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
